## Incompatible protocols

***Shifu***'s microservices architecture empowers ***Shifu*** with unparalleled scalability and allows ***Shifu*** to be compatible with new protocols quickly.

If the protocol used is not yet supported by ***Shifu***, please [submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/issues/new) and we will support it ASAP!
