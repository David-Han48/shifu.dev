Shifu continues to add new toolclass services to ensure it is compatible with different protocols and drivers.

### MQTT Broker

MQTT brokers are used to help subscribe and post MQTT information. Presently, Shifu uses [Mosquito](https://mosquitto.org/) to achieve compatibility.

### RTSP Client

The RTSP Client ensures the transmission of streaming media information.

### Siemens S7 Suite

Siemens S7 Suite supports the operation of PLC Siemens S7. Presently, Shifu uses [Snap7](http://snap7.sourceforge.net/) for compatibility.

### HTTP to SSH driver stub

The HTTP to SSH driver stub enables Shifu to allow users to add new command line drivers at will. See [Remote Invocation of Command Line Drivers](shifu-advanced-functions/remote-driver-execution.md).
