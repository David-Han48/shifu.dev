# Features

***Shifu***, as the next generation of IoT application development framework, strives to provide a one-stop solution for IoT application developers. 

## By Working Process of IoT application development

Based on the principle "Born for Developers", ***Shifu*** divides the work of IoT application development into six following major categories:

1. Device Access
1. Device Management
1. Data Collection
1. Device Control
1. Application Development
1. System Operation and Maintenance

## Device Access

The advanced microservices architecture empowers ***Shifu*** with unparalleled scalability and allows ***Shifu*** to access new devices quickly.

## Device Management

***Shifu*** comes with a device management framework that makes it easy to check the operating status of devices, update device drivers, perform security configurations, and other operations.

## Data Collection

On ***Shifu***, you can automate data collection with ease.

## Device Control

On ***Shifu***, you can attain automated device control through data collection.

## Application Development

On ***Shifu***, each device generates a corresponding digital twin ([***deviceShifu***](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/blob/main/docs/design/design-deviceShifu.md)). Developers can utilize the capabilities of the device with unparalleled ease by simply calling the API exposed by [***deviceShifu***](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/blob/main/docs/design/design-deviceShifu.md).

```bash
curl http://robot-arm/grip/
```

For example, this simple command above can make a robotic arm complete a grasping move.

The aim of ***Shifu*** is to **help developers to create a complex IoT application as easy as creating a mobile app**!

## System Operation and Maintenance

As integrated with `Kubernetes`' capabilities, ***Shifu*** was born with two advantages in operation and maintenance:

1. ***Shifu***, based on Kubernetes, enables developers to unify the management of applications and IoT devices by operating and maintaining only one set of k8s clusters, eliminating the need to operate and maintain an additional set of IoT platforms.
1. Never having singular-point failures. Unlike other IoT platforms, [***Shifu***'s architecture](shifu-architecture/architecture.md) can be created several copies of ***deviceShifu***, so there will never be a singular-point failure. In fact, ***Shifu*** has already accumulated 500,000 hours of operation without failure in use cases (factories, labs, supply chain, etc.) of several Fortune 500 company clients.

## By ***Shifu***'s Module
